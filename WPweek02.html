			<h2 class= "assignmentname"> John Berger: Ways of Seeing </h2>
			<p class= "bodytext"> Episode 1: Berger explores the initial meaning behind paintings under the assumption that they would only exist singularly in one site specific location. It creates something with great depth and intimacy with the viewer. Once the camera was invented it dampened and dismantled all prior existing meaning European oil paintings held. These paintings were made with the intention of being viewed uniquely and singularly and now that they can bc replicated and exist in numerous places at once the intentions are no longer relevant and the meaning shifts to something that has more to do with the context of the image rather than the environment it was placed in. 
I felt that Berger was making good points but I do not think that the change in the meaning is as detrimental as he does. The intention remains, just because there is more than one copy of an image and can be seen in a manner that the artists could not have imagined does not mean that the foundation of the entire work is shifted. I think the camera had a positive impact on art because it enable an accessibility to fine art that did not exist before, and as someone who has not had the opportunity to travel I am grateful for the ability to see art that is on display in other countries.

Episode 2: This episode was entirely on the topic of nude paintings with female subjects and that they mean to women, what they do for/to women, their intentions, and their consequences. Berger pointed out the intimacy of the nude and how much intention and forethought must go into their creation by the artist and the model. One becomes aware that they are on display and is not bare, rather wearing the weight of the viewer on them and the skin they wear. The fetishization of women in these paintings originated as an homage to the female beauty but it is not an homage to women or for women- it is homage of women for men. I really enjoyed this episode of the series. The male gaze and it impact on the female psyche is a topic of great interest for me and as an artist the issue of nude paintings took on an entirely new meaning to me now. I will definitely approach the topic differently now and will most likely have a more conscious and aware intent while creating my pieces.  </p>

<p class= "bodytext">Episode 3: This episode was all about the representation a painting holds. Not only what the subject represents but what the physical object the painting. Of course originally paintings and fine art were considered status symbols because of their price points and unattainability, which calls back to the previously discussed shift in meaning that replication caused. However, it is not just the status symbol that Berger is talking about. The oil paint, materials, transportation, upkeep, and display also acts as a representation for the true essence of the painting. It creates a reflection of not only the artist but the owner of the piece, as well as the viewer.

Episode 4: This episode explored the differences and similarities between European oil painting and publicity. Both are images that surround is and offer an alternative way of life. Oil paintings focus on what the creator already has and  already knows while reality focuses on what the consumer does not have but dreams about and can achieve if they just bought more things. I thought this was a really interesting commentary on the effect consumerism had on visual art and how it was perverted with the intention of audience manipulation rather than organic well intentioned messages by an artist to an audience.  The concepts of glamour and power dynamics that go into publicity are sneaky yet effective tactics for the means of marketing they are working towards. It feels as if reinforcing self loathing is the only way publicity can function while oil paintings and their artists only specific intention was to paint what they knew and their organic power focuses and feelings of self loathing rather than the ones forced on us now.

             <p class="title"> Music is Meaning </p>
          <p class="sub">and Meaning is Cyclical</p>
          <br>
          <p class="bodyinfo">Music has the power that it does because of personal meaning conflated with the content based on past experience and social living. These factors of musical significance are also the ones that inspire musical creation. You cannot have one without the other. 
          This feeds into the base concept that is widely known: meaning is the foundation for all media. And meaning is a two way street of what you feed into it and what you take from it.</p>

          <p class="sub">Physical Realm</p>
          <br>
          <p class="bodyinfo">Seeing that this is true and we apply meaning to sound, consider the world in conjunction to sound. The colloquialism ‚Äúif a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it really fall?‚Äù is a good foundational phrase in this instance. And simply the answer is no. a space is only created once there is a body to acknowledge both the space and the social activities that go on as a result of their presence. \
        A social space as defined by Lefebure is both ‚Äúwork (the interaction) and the product (what is created by the interaction).‚Äù 
        ‚Äúthe social activities that occur in a particular time and place that constitute and are specific to the establishment of a distinct social context‚Äù- Craig L. Wilkins </p>

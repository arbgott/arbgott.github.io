       <p class="title"> Space Is</p>
          <br>
          <p class="bodyinfo">1. a phenomenon of spatial organization and use, realized in
a distinct social context (people interacting)
<br>
2. dependent on experience and memory, linked to timeâ€”
past, present, and future
<br>
3. defined and communicated by people through patterns of use
</p>
<p class="sub">BUT when you consider that</p>
<p class="bodyinfo">is derived from experience and memory, whose communication is
performed, and music is derived from experience and memory,
whose form of communication is performance, then might we not
look at sound and space as a similar occurrence, constitutive of each
other</p>
<p class="subsub"> it is more accurate to consider it like this</p>
<p class="bodyinfo">
1. socially constructed phenomenon of sonic organization
and use
<br>
2. dependent on experience and memory, linked to timeâ€”
past, present, and future
<br>
3. defined and communicated by people through their patterns of use</p>

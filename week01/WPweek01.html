			<h2 class= "assignmentname"> Reading Response </h2>
			<p class= "bodytext"> While reading the article 'As We May Think' I did not realize when it was published which caused a reasonable amount of confusion. I was struggling to figure out what I was actually reading or why. Once the author actually began to describe the 'memex' I began to understand where it was going with all of the random discussion of cameras and television. By the end of the article I understood (still without knowing the publication date). Not only was the author calling into question why these advancements have not been made yet (because the collective focus has been on war and violence up until then) but also even though we had yet to make these advancements and it felt as if might not ever if we continue to be so focused on self destruction, there very clearly was still hope for tech advancement, growth, and evolution in a manner that would only improve humanity rather than put it in danger. Not only was it imaginable but it could be possible soon if the collective focus is allowed to shift to accademia rather than violence.

'Long Live the Web' was a much more understandable article. It was easier to understand the point of the article. It broke down how the web and the internet functions and the fundamental rights a person has when it comes to accessing the web. As the internet evolves and expands it has become increasingly hard to determine the line between what can and cannot be regulated as well as what should be regulated or not. The internet is a place of connection and freedom and is not specific to any one country or region, therefore no governments should be establishing much control over their civilians and their internet usage. However, in terms of commerce and affairs of the state it is warranted for regulation to be a concern and required. The line between what a government can and cannot control on the internet will be forever blurred because there will always be some way of distorting the freedoms the internet provides a person into evils and opportunities for malice. </p>

<p class= "bodytext"> The two articles both discuss the matter of linking information and creating a means of accessing data in a more streamlined fashion. 'As We May Think' discusses linking in a physical manner which is understandable considering it was published in 1945 and the more digital manner of stringing informational sites together was not even a concept at the time. The 'memex' was a physical theory of the internet and is essentially what it became, but smaller than a desk. 'Long Live the Web' explains the linking function the internet achieves  through URL use or in the vocabulary of Tim Berners Lee, URIs. And knowing that the 'memex' was intended to streamline the accessibility of data and research it is safe to say that the dream of Vannevar Bush was accomplished.  </p>

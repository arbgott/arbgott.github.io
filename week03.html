			<h2 class= "assignmentname"> Web Work; A History of Internet Art </h2>
			<p class= "bodytext"> Web Work; The HIstory of Internet Art was a really interesting article to read. It discusses various artists taking advantage of how little was known about the internet when it first became accessible and how it led to an entire culture. At first the ‘net.arists’ flocked to the internet just to test the bounds of technology and how they could manipulate it to reflect their own message, as seen with the feminism and tech movement in the late 90’s that the article outlines. The people who were creating net.art at this point were the radical artists who stood for something and wanted to create an impact and a lasting message-- what better way to do that than with the latest phenomenon? 


What I find humorous and ironic though, is that these artists and creators come into the tech space to mess around and learn their way through their creations and manage to become the authorities in the field as a result. These artists have become legends- people who defined what the internet could become before we knew what it would be. They know their way through HTML and design so well and so thoroughly that now laymen look to them to learn basics and techniques that was simply found and cultivated rather than known and taught.

Additionally, at this time no one knew anything about the internet's capabilities or how to control it in the ways we can today so the art these technological pioneers were creating was not breaking any rules rather was exploring the gray areas that made up the internet. At some point there was a departure from exploration to definition and we began to learn more about the internet from these artists and developers than we ever would have known or discovered for ourselves.

I think that if these artists knew what the internet would become and what kind of culture it would create they would have been more cautious and maybe they would have instituted more guidelines and caution when exploring.
